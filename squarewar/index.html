 <h2>Game rules in short:
 </h2>
 <h2>(1) The game is played on the same chess board as Go: 19Ã—19 two-dimensional
grid.
 </h2>
 <h2>(2) The game is played by two sides. One side uses black stones (game pieces)
and the other side uses white stones. This is also the same as Go.
 </h2>
 <h2>(3) The black side first places a stone on an empty intersection and then two
sides alternately place stones on empty intersections with their side colors.
However, once a stone is placed, it cannot be removed.
 </h2>
 <h2> (4) To add difficulty to the black side, <font size="25" color="red">the first two stones of the black side
must be adjacent on a line of the grid. </font>
 </h2>
 <h2>(5) When four stones of a side become the four vertices of a square and the
edges of this square overlap the grid lines, this side wins the game.
 </h2>
  <h2>For example, the black side wins in the figure below. </h2>
